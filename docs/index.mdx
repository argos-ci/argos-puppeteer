# Use Argos with Puppeteer

Integrating Argos with your [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) tests to enable visual testing on your application.

Puppeteer already offers a command to take screenshots. The official Argos Puppeteer integration uses it but also does several things:

- Wait for all images to be loaded
- Wait for all fonts to be loaded
- Wait for no `aria-busy` (loader) elements to be present in the page
- Hide scrollbars
- Hide carets
- Expose CSS helpers to help you hiding content

## Setup

```
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/cli @argos-ci/puppeteer
```

## Usage

`argosScreenshot(page, name[, options])`

- `page` - A `puppeteer` page instance
- `name` - The screenshot name; must be unique
- `options` - See [Page.screenshot command options](https://pptr.dev/next/api/puppeteer.page.screenshot/)
- `options.element` - Accept an ElementHandle or a string selector to screenshot an element

```js
describe("Integration test with visual testing", () => {
  it("loads the homepage", async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto(TEST_URL);
    await argosScreenshot(page, this.test.fullTitle());
  });
});
```

Screenshots are stored in `screenshots/argos` folder, relative to current directory.

### Helper attributes

The `data-visual-test` attributes allow you to control how elements behave in the Argos screenshot.

It is often used to hide changing element like dates.

- `[data-visual-test="transparent"]` - Make the element transparent (`opacity: 0`)
- `[data-visual-test="removed"]` - Remove the element (`display: none`)

```html
<!-- Hide a div from a screenshot -->
<div id="clock" data-visual-test="transparent">...</div>
```

## Upload screenshots to Argos

Before publishing, generate a unique `<project-token>` by [subscribing to Argos](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci).

Once you installed the `@argos-ci/cli` package and have a `<project-token>`, run the following command in your project directory.

```
npx argos upload --token <project-token> screenshots/argos
```
